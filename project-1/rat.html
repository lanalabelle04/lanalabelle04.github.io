            Originally, there was a cat and a rat, who hated each other with a passion. These two were the worst swimmers in
            the animal kingdom, but they were both smart. They found out that the fastest way to the river is to hop on top
            of the ox. The generous ox agreed to carry them across the river. However, the rat was so eager to win that he
            pushed the cat into the water. The rat came first in the race.
