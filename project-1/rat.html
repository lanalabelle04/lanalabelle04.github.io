    <h2> THE RAT </h2>

    <p>
        Originally, there was a cat and a rat, who hated each other with a passion. These two were the worst swimmers in
        the animal kingdom, but they were both smart. They found out that the fastest way to the river is to hop on top
        of the ox. The generous ox agreed to carry them across the river. However, the rat was so eager to win that he
        pushed the cat into the water. The rat came first in the race.
