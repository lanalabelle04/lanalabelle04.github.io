  <h2> THE RABBIT </h2>

  <p> 
    All of a sudden, a loud thumping sound came: it was the rabbit. It jumped from one stone to another and was doing
    well until it slipped. Fortunately, there was a log floating by and it grabbed onto that log and floated to the
    finish line, earning fourth place in the race.
